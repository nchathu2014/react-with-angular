# ReactJS with AngularJS
Approach to plug ReactJS webcomponent to AngularJS application

# Technical pointout
- Here I use ES5 syntax format to create the React component and it is possible to do the same thing using ES6.
- Also use the pre-compile Component file (JS) , We can do the same thing in project buildup using Grunt or Gulp
- After Plug the component in to the Angular world component is self sustaining (if expose a external JS module to handle the API calls)

# Run
- bower install

# Test
Run in any http server Ex:- http://localhost:7000/index.html
